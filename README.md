# PersonalZone - Modified, Semi-Working AnimeZone
**WARNING: This application (PersonalZone) and the original (AnimeZone) are NO longer supported! PersonalZone is only a temporary fix and will eventually stop working completely. It is _highly_ recommended to check out an alternative app instead.** 

[CloudStream](https://github.com/LagradOst/CloudStream-3) by [LagradOst](https://github.com/LagradOst) is my personal favorite (althoug without MAL/AniList support). Or visit [r/animeapp](https://www.reddit.com/r/animeapp/) on Reddit for other possible alternatives.

**If you wish to continue using PersonalZone, check for releases here: https://github.com/AZoneLive/PersonalZone/releases**
**Once installed, visit Settings -> App Settings -> GogoAnime -> Set domain as `gogoanime.ai` or `gogoanime.sh` for infinite loading fix.**
If you're coming from the original AnimeZone, please uninstall it before installing PersonalZone.

As much as it is desired, updating PersonalZone any further is, regrettably, an unlikely impossibility. With AnimeZone's core being built on the Flutter development framework (and more specifically, compiled on top of the Dart layer), it is nearly impossible to reverse engineer without extensive in-depth knowledge of undocumented Dart formats.<br/>

If I ever feel the motivation to create my own, actually, Personal app from the ground up, I will post an update. But for now, thanks for all of your support and many thanks to the AnimeZone team for the amazing application. It's been an honor. :wave:
